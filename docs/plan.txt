Objective:
Design and implement a Python-based automated reporting system that:
●  Runs every Monday at 6 AM (automatically scheduled).
●  Extracts the number of students who failed in tests over the last week.
●  Categorizes failures by:
    ○  Standard (grade level)
    ○  Subject
    ○  Comparison with the student’s previous test’s percentage (to track  improvement/decline)
●  Generates a summary using an LLM.
●  Sends the report via email.
